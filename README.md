# Game-2048
This is my implementation for the Game 2048.
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
## How to run the game
1. Install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) on your machine

2. Clone this repository on your local machine

```
3. Compile and run the file Main.java 
``` 
$ javac Main.java 
$ java Main
